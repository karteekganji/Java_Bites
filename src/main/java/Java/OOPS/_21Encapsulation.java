	 * Encapsulation simply means binding object state(fields) and
	 * behavior(methods) together. If you are creating class, you are doing
	 * encapsulation.
	 */
	
	/**
	 * The whole idea behind encapsulation is to hide the  implementation details 
	 * from users. If a data member is private it means it can only be accessed within
	 * the same class. No outside class can access private data member (variable) of other class.
	 * 
	 * However if we setup public getter and setter methods to update (for
	 * example void setSSN(int ssn))and read (for example int getSSN()) the
	 * private data fields then the outside class can access those private data
	 * fields via public methods.
	 * 
	 * This way data can only be accessed by public methods thus making the
	 * private fields and their implementation hidden for outside classes.
	 * Thatâ€™s why encapsulation is known as data hiding. Lets see an example to
	 * understand this concept better.
	 * 
	 * Example of Encapsulation in Java How to implement encapsulation in java:
	 * 1) Make the instance variables private so that they cannot be accessed
	 * directly from outside the class. You can only set and get values of these
	 * variables through the methods of the class. 
	 * 2) Have getter and setter methods in the class to set and get the values of the fields.
