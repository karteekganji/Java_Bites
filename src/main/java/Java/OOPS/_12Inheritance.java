	 * Inheritance
	 * 
	 * The process by which one class acquires the properties and
	 * functionalities of another class is called inheritance. Inheritance
	 * provides the idea of re-usability of code and each sub class defines only
	 * those features that are unique to it, rest of the features can be
	 * inherited from the parent class.
	 * 
	 * 1). Inheritance is a process of defining a new class based on an existing
	 * class by extending its common data members and methods. 
	 * 2). Inheritance allows us to reuse of code, it improves reusability in your java
	 * application. 
	 * 3). The parent class is called the base class or super class.
	 * The child class that extends the base class is called the derived class
	 * or sub class or child class. 
	 * 
	 * Note: The biggest advantage of Inheritance is that the code in base class need not 
	 * be rewritten in the child class. The variables and methods of the base class can be 
	 * used in the child class as well.
	 * 
	 * Syntax: Inheritance in Java
	 * 
	 * To inherit a class we use extends keyword. Here class A is child class
	 * and class B is parent class.
	 * 
	 * class A extends B { 
	 * }

	 * Inheritance Example :

	 * In this example, we have a parent class Teacher and a child class
	 * MathTeacher. In the MathTeacher class we need not to write the same code
	 * which is already present in the present class. Here we have college name,
	 * designation and does() method that is common for all the teachers, thus
	 * MathTeacher class does not need to write this code, the common data
	 * members and methods can inherited from the Teacher class.
