/*
 * public static void main(String[] args) { 
 * This is our next line in the program, lets break it down to understand it:
 * public: This makes the main method public that means that we can call the method from outside the class.
 * 
 * static: We do not need to create object for static methods to run. They can
 * run itself.
 * 
 * void: It does not return anything.
 * 
 * main: It is the method name. This is the entry point method from which the
 * JVM can run your program.
 * 
 * (String[] args): Used for command line arguments that are passed as strings.
 * We will cover that in a separate post.
